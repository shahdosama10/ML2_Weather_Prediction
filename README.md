# ML2_Weather_Prediction


### Overview  
This project uses machine learning techniques to analyze weather data and predict rainfall. It includes data preprocessing, implementing algorithms (Decision Tree, k-Nearest Neighbors, and Naïve Bayes), and evaluating their performance using various metrics.  

### Dataset  
- **Source**: A modified weather forecast dataset obtained from Kaggle.  
- **Features**: 6 features.  
- **Observations**: 2,500.  
- **Goal**: Predict whether it will rain based on the dataset.

### Tasks  

#### **Task 1: Preprocessing**  
1. Identify missing data in the dataset.  
2. Handle missing data using:  
   - Dropping missing values.  
   - Replacing missing values with the feature average.  
3. Check and apply feature scaling to ensure consistent data scaling.  
4. Split the dataset into training and testing sets before feature scaling.  

#### **Task 2: Algorithm Implementation**  
- **Decision Tree, kNN, and Naïve Bayes using scikit-learn**:  
  - Evaluate each algorithm using accuracy, precision, and recall metrics.  
- **Custom kNN Implementation**:  
  - Implement kNN from scratch.  
  - Compare performance with scikit-learn's kNN implementation using the same metrics.  

#### **Task 3: Reporting and Analysis**  
1. **Impact of Missing Data Handling**:  
   - Evaluate the performance of scikit-learn algorithms using the two missing data handling techniques.  
2. **Decision Tree Analysis**:  
   - Plot and explain the Decision Tree.  
   - Discuss splitting criteria and logic at each node.  
3. **Performance Metrics**:  
   - Evaluate the custom kNN implementation for at least five different `k` values.  
   - Compare results with scikit-learn’s implementation.
